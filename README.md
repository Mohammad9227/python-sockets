# Python Socket Example

This project demonstrates a simple client-server interaction using Python's socket library. The server listens for connections from clients on the local network, receives messages, and echoes them back to the client.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Project Structure

- `server.py`: Contains the server code which listens for client connections and echoes received messages.
- `client.py`: Contains the client code which sends messages to the server and receives echoes.

## Setup and Running

### Running the Server

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `server.py`.
3. Run the server using Python:
    ```bash
    python server.py
# python-sockets
